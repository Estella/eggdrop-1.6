                               Compiling FAQ


  This FAQ may help you successfully compile Eggdrop. Suggestions are by
  various contributors. If you think something should be added, please send
  an e-mail to eggdev@eggheads.org. Note that in this document, text between
  a '<' and a '>' should be replaced (without the '<' and '>').

  1. I get lots of warnings

    Warnings do not necessarily mean anything bad. As long as the compile
    completes, there is really nothing to worry about. Generally, we try to
    avoid warnings. We try to fix the warnings we are aware of. If you
    experience warnings, you can let us know by e-mailing bugs@eggheads.org.
    If you feel like fixing them yourself, please do so and send us a patch
    (as described in doc/patch.howto). Thanks.


  2. The bot crashes at startup in "net.c/708", for example

    On some non-IA32 systems, the gcc options -O2 and -O3 can cause this. We
    don't know why this happens, but sometimes it helps to remove these flags
    from the Makefile. To disable them, use:

      ./configure --disable-cc-optimization

    Please e-mail eggdev@eggheads.org if you know why this happens, so we can
    extend the info here.


  3. There is no Tcl installed on your shell

    If there really is no Tcl installed on your shell, you can install
    it temporarily in /tmp or your /home. Get the latest version of Tcl from
    ftp://tcl.activestate.com/pub/tcl/ and follow the installation steps in its
    README file. After you've installed Tcl, you have to make configure detect
    Tcl. To achieve this, do the following:

      1. Depending on what shell your using:

        bash/ksh:
          export LB_LIBRARY_PATH='<path to directory containing Tcl library>'

        csh/tcsh/tclsh:
          setenv LB_LIBRARY_PATH '<path to directory containing Tcl library>'

      2. Run the following command from your Eggdrop compilation directory
         (this is all one command):

        ./configure --with-tclinc='<full path to tcl.h>'
        --with-tcllib='<full path to Tcl library>'

      3. Continue compiling the bot, starting with 'make config'.


 4. strip terminated with signal 6 (various)

   collect2: strip terminated with signal 6 [IOT/Abort trap]
   *** Exit 1
   Stop.
   *** Exit 1
   Stop.

   You can cut out this problem by not stripping the binary (obviously). Edit
   your Makefile, and change this line from:

     GMAKE = ${MAKE} 'CC=gcc' 'AWK=awk' 'OBJS=${OBJS}' 'TCLLIBFN=tcl.a'\
             'CFLAGS=${CFLAGS}' 'XREQ=${XREQ}' 'XLIBS= -L/usr/local/lib -ltcl -lm' \
             'TCLLIB=${TCLLIB}' 'RANLIB=ranlib' 'STRIP=-s'

   To (your lines may differ, but what you are doing is changing 'STRIP=-s'
   to 'STRIP='):

     GMAKE = ${MAKE} 'CC=gcc' 'AWK=awk' 'OBJS=${OBJS}' 'TCLLIBFN=tcl.a'\
             'CFLAGS=${CFLAGS}' 'XREQ=${XREQ}' 'XLIBS= -L/usr/local/lib -ltcl -lm' \
             'TCLLIB=${TCLLIB}' 'RANLIB=ranlib' 'STRIP='


  5. 'DIR' undeclared (and a whole bunch of others) (AIX 4)

    gcc -c -O2 -fno-strength-reduce -I.. -DHAVE_CONFIG_H  filedb.c
    filedb.c: In function `filedb_update':
    filedb.c:209: `DIR' undeclared (first use this function)
    filedb.c:209: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
    filedb.c:209: for each function it appears in.)
    filedb.c:209: `dir' undeclared (first use this function)
    filedb.c:209: parse error before `*'
    filedb.c:217: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
    filedb.c:218: `name' undeclared (first use this function)
    filedb.c:218: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
    filedb.c:220: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
    filedb.c:220: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
    filedb.c:224: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
    filedb.c:224: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
    filedb.c:225: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
    filedb.c:230: `s' undeclared (first use this function)
    filedb.c:231: `st' undeclared (first use this function)
    filedb.c:232: `fdb' undeclared (first use this function)
    filedb.c:232: `where' undeclared (first use this function)
    filedb.c:237: `fdb1' undeclared (first use this function)
    filedb.c:253: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
    make: The error code from the last command is 1.

    The configure script didn't detect that this particular system had dirent.h
    and sys/dir.h. The solution is to add -DHAVE_DIRENT_H -DHAVE_SYS_DIR_H to
    the Makefile's CFLGS line:

      CFLGS = -DHAVE_DIRENT_H -DHAVE_SYS_DIR_H


  6. 'fd_set' undeclared (and a whole bunch of others) (AIX 4)

    gcc -c -O2 -fno-strength-reduce -I.. -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -DHAVE_DIRENT_H -DHAVE_SYS_DIR_H net.c
    net.c: In function `sockread':
    net.c:390: `fd_set' undeclared (first use this function)
    net.c:390: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
    net.c:390: for each function it appears in.)
    net.c:390: parse error before `fd'
    net.c:396: `fd' undeclared (first use this function)
    make: The error code from the last command is 1.

    Again, this seems that one of configure's components (sed, awk,
    or something along those lines) is broken, and configure failed to
    detect that this system needed sys/select.h. The solution is to add
    -DHAVE_SYS_SELECT_H to the Makefile's CFLGS line:

      CFLGS = -DHAVE_DIRENT_H -DHAVE_SYS_DIR_H -DHAVE_SYS_SELECT_H


  7. Unresolved or undefined symbols: ldclose, ldopen, ldnshread (AIX 3)

    cc -s -o eggdrop chan.o chanprog.o chanset.o cmds.o dcc.o dccutil.o
    filedb.o fileq.o files.o gotdcc.o hash.o main.o match.o mem.o misc.o
    mode.o msgcmds.o msgnotice.o net.o tandcmd.o tandem.o tcl.o tclhash.o
    userrec.o users.o -L/home2/f/foster/lib -ltcl7.5 -lm
       0706-317 ERROR: Unresolved or undefined symbols detected:
                       Symbols in error (followed by references) are dumped to the load map.
                       The -bloadmap:<filename> option will create a load map.
       .ldclose
       .ldopen
       .ldnshread
       make: 1254-004 The error code from the last command is 8.

    Apparently, what is happening is a library called ld is required. Either
    configure doesn't know it is needed, it simply can't find it, or maybe
    this is a unique case. The solution is to have ld linked in with the final
    binary.

    Edit your Makefile and find the line that looks something like this:

      GMAKE = ${MAKE} 'CC=cc' 'AWK=awk' 'OBJS=${OBJS}' 'TCLLIBFN=tcl7.5.a'\
              'CFLAGS=${CFLAGS}' 'XREQ=${XREQ}' 'XLIBS= -L/home2/f/foster/lib -ltcl7.5 -lm'\
              'TCLLIB=${TCLLIB}' 'RANLIB=ranlib' 'STRIP=-s'

    Add in -lld into the XLIBS assignment, like this:

      GMAKE = ${MAKE} 'CC=cc' 'AWK=awk' 'OBJS=${OBJS}' 'TCLLIBFN=tcl7.5.a'\
              'CFLAGS=${CFLAGS}' 'XREQ=${XREQ}' 'XLIBS=-lld -L/home2/f/foster/lib -ltcl7.5 -lm'\
              'TCLLIB=${TCLLIB}' 'RANLIB=ranlib' 'STRIP=-s'

  8. Unsatisfied symbols 'shl_findsym' and 'shl_load' (HP-UX 9)

    gcc -s -o eggdrop chan.o chanprog.o chanset.o cmds.o dcc.o
    dccutil.o filedb.o fileq.o files.o gotdcc.o hash.o main.o match.o
    mem.o misc.o mode.o msgcmds.o msgnotice.o net.o tandcmd.o tandem.o
    tcl.o tclhash.o userrec.o users.o -L/home/hltran/tcl/lib -ltcl7.5 -lm
       /bin/ld: Unsatisfied symbols:
          shl_findsym (code)
          shl_load (code)
       collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
       *** Error code 1
       Stop.

    Upgrade to a later version of Tcl. The following should also work.

    Edit your Makefile and find the line that looks something like this:

      GMAKE = ${MAKE} 'CC=gcc' 'AWK=awk' 'OBJS=${OBJS}' 'TCLLIBFN=tcl7.5.a'\
              'CFLAGS=${CFLAGS}' 'XREQ=${XREQ}' 'XLIBS= -L/usr/local/lib -ltcl7.5 -lm'\
              'TCLLIB=${TCLLIB}' 'RANLIB=:' 'STRIP='

    Add in -lld into the XLIBS assignment, like this:

      GMAKE = ${MAKE} 'CC=gcc' 'AWK=awk' 'OBJS=${OBJS}' 'TCLLIBFN=tcl7.5.a'\
              'CFLAGS=${CFLAGS}' 'XREQ=${XREQ}' 'XLIBS=-ldl -L/usr/local/lib -ltcl7.5 -lm'\
              'TCLLIB=${TCLLIB}' 'RANLIB=:' 'STRIP='


  9. The bot doesn't compile on Ultrix

    There are some known problems with make and Eggdrop on Ultrix systems. Try
    using gmake instead of make. Additionally, sh5 should be used. A simple
    'gmake SHELL=/bin/sh5' should work.


  10. Compile stops at the last minute with "ld fatal signal 11"! (Linux)

    This seems to be caused by a non-ELF Tcl library binary, and the compiler
    doesn't seem to like it. The first thing you want to do is download and
    compile Tcl yourself. Then, follow this set of commands commands to help
    you reconfigure Eggdrop using the newly compiled Tcl library (all of this
    should be done from your home directory):

      1. Depending on what shell your using:

        bash/ksh:
          export LB_LIBRARY_PATH='<path to directory containing Tcl library>'

        csh/tcsh/tclsh:
          setenv LB_LIBRARY_PATH '<path to directory containing Tcl library>'

      2. Run the following command from your Eggdrop compilation directory
         (this is all one command):

        ./configure --with-tclinc='<full path to tcl.h>'
        --with-tcllib='<full path to Tcl library>'

      3. Continue compiling the bot, starting with 'make config'.


  11. Undefined references in net.o (Sun OS)

                   First
    Undefined    Referenced
     Symbol       In file

    socket          net.o
    gethostbyname   net.o
    accept          net.o
    bind            net.o
    setsockopt      net.o
    gethostbyaddr   net.o
    getsockname     net.o
    gethostname     net.o
    listen          net.o
    connect         net.o
    ld: fatal: Symbol referencing errors. No output written to eggdrop

    This seems to be caused by a few libraries not being detected by the
    auto-configure script; it is relatively easy to fix. Edit your Makefile.
    Note that yours may be slightly different than this one when it comes to
    the Tcl library, but here is the way it probably is:

      GMAKE = ${MAKE} 'CC=gcc' 'AWK=awk' 'OBJS=${OBJS}' 'TCLLIBFN=tcl.a'\
              'CFLAGS=${CFLAGS}' 'XREQ=${XREQ}' 'XLIBS= -L/usr/local/lib -ltcl -lm'\
              'TCLLIB=${TCLLIB}' 'RANLIB=:' 'STRIP='

    Here is what you need to change it to:

      GMAKE = ${MAKE} 'CC=gcc' 'AWK=awk' 'OBJS=${OBJS}' 'TCLLIBFN=tcl.a'\
              'CFLAGS=${CFLAGS}' 'XREQ=${XREQ}' 'XLIBS=-lsocket -ldl -lnsl -L/usr/local/lib -ltcl -lm'\
              'TCLLIB=${TCLLIB}' 'RANLIB=:' 'STRIP='

    You are adding three libraries to be linked in: socket, dl, and nsl. This
    will resolve the net.o errors.


  12. ld: -ltcl7.4: expected libx.so(.major.minor.xxx) (various)

    ld: -ltcl7.4: expected libx.so(.major.minor.xxx)
    collect2: ld returned 4 exit status
    *** Error code 1
    make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `eggdrop'

    On some UNIX boxes, this seems to be caused by the linker. It is expecting
    a specific filename format, and when the filename doesn't live up to its
    expectations, it usually barfs. I always see this when the library for Tcl
    is called libtcl7.4.a or libtcl7.5.a. If you installed Tcl yourself, rename
    it to libtcl.a. If you didn't and your using the Tcl that the system admin
    installed, then do the following:

      1. View your Makefile. Look for the line (should be close to the top)
         that is similar to:

        XREQ = /usr/local/lib/libtcl7.4.a

      2. Remember this path. The next thing you want to do, depending on what
         shell your using, is:

        bash/ksh:
          export LB_LIBRARY_PATH='<path to DIRECTORY from XREQ line>'

        csh/tcsh/tclsh:
          setenv LB_LIBRARY_PATH '<path to DIRECTORY from XREQ line>'

      3. Run the following command from your Eggdrop compilation directory
         (this is all one command):

        ./configure --with-tclinc='<full path to tcl.h>'
        --with-tcllib='<full path to Tcl library from XREQ line>'

      4. Continue compiling the bot, starting with 'make config'.

  13. I experiance problems starting the configure script (AIX/various)

    If you receive file descriptor or bad interpreter errors when attempting
    to run the configure script, try running 'sh configure' or 'bash configure'
    instead of './configure'. This problem seems to show up on many AIX
    machines.
