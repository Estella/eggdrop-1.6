.SH NAME
eggdrop \- an IRC robot program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B eggdrop
.RB [ options ]
.RB [ config-file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I eggdrop
is a fully-functional Internet Relay Chat robot program.  It
is stand-alone, and does not require the
.I ircII
client.  It currently supports all known IRC nets, including EFnet,
IRCNet, Dalnet and Undernet.
.PP
By itself,
.I eggdrop
does nothing.  It needs a config file (usually named after your bot)
to tell it how to behave.  The
config file is actually a script written in
.I "enhanced Tcl"
(Tcl with extra commands and variables defined by eggdrop).  A sample
Tcl config file with describing comments for each option,
.IR eggdrop.conf.dist ,
is given with the distribution.
.SH OPTIONS
.I eggdrop
options include:
.TP
.B \-h
displays a list of command-line options.
.TP
.B \-v
displays the current version of eggdrop, as well as any patches that have
been loaded.
.TP
.B \-n
.I eggdrop
normally automatically moves into the background upon loading.  This
option makes it stay in the foreground and display console entries
to the console terminal.
.TP
.B \-nc
Like
.B \-n
the bot won't move into the background.  However, the console terminal
will display channel status every 10 seconds, instead of log entries.
.TP
.B \-nt
As above, the bot won't move into the background.  The console terminal
simulates a local DCC chat which never ends (as long as the bot is
running).  The nickname used for the DCC chat is "HQ" (a master).
.TP
.B \-m
The first time you run
.IR eggdrop ,
you need to use the -m option, to
put eggdrop in "userfile creation" mode.  Follow the directions
and it will build a user record database, with you listed as
an 'owner' (person who runs the bot).
.SH SIGNALS
.I eggdrop
handles the following signals:
.TP
.B SIGCHLD
This signal is ignored by
.I eggdrop
and can be used to determine whether it's running or not.
.TP
.B SIGTERM
Depending on die-on-sigterm being set to 0 or 1 in the config file,
.I eggdrop
will save the user file or die.
.TP
.B SIGHUP
Depending on die-on-sighup being set to 0 or 1 in the config file,
.I eggdrop
will rehash or die.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.B EGG_LANG
This variable can be set to the language you want
.I eggdrop
to speak to you. It defaults to English, but German and French are
supported, too.
.TP
.B EGG_LANGDIR
Specifies the directory where all your language files are stored.
The default is ./language
