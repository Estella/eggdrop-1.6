    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Eggdrop was created around
      December 1993 to help stop the incessant wars on #gayteen. It spawned
      from another bot that was in the process of being written at the time
      called &quot;Unrest&quot;. The purpose of Unrest was to answer help
      requests from other bots. The first public release was v0.6, and since
      then, it has grown into what you have before you.</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">To use Eggdrop, you
      need:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">some sort of Unix account
        -- it does not compile for Windows or Mac machines, nor will it
        probably ever compile there</FONT></LI>

        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">pretty good knowledge of
        IRC and Unix, including how to compile programs and what DCC chat is,
        at absolute minimum</FONT></LI>

        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">about 500k of disk space,
        or more, depending on your system (on Linux, the executable itself
        takes up about 200k currently -- it will be a lot larger on a RISC
        system)</FONT></LI>

        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">the Tcl libraries -- if
        you don&#39;t have them (and most systems should), check the README
        file on info about how to install it yourself (you don&#39;t need to
        be root)</FONT></LI>
      </UL>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Before starting, ask
      yourself if you really need a bot. Most IRC servers allow only a
      handful of bots -- some forbid them outright. The reason? Too many
      people run bots as &quot;toys&quot; or as a means of destruction. If
      you want to use Eggdrop for destructive purposes, go ahead and erase
      this directory now. It&#39;s almost impossible to do what you want with
      this bot.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">You should try to find at
      least one server that will allow you to run a bot. If you use an ISP
      (Internet Service Provider) that runs its own IRC server, check to make
      sure that bots are okay. If you&#39;re going to use a server somewhere
      else, read the MOTD (message of the day) and find out what their bot
      policy is. Following the rules will go a long way toward making your
      bot accepted.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Generally speaking, you only
      need a bot on EFnet if your channel has a constant supply of users (24
      hours a day) and no bot. If your channel already has a couple of bots
      on it, it probably doesn&#39;t need any more. More bots don&#39;t do
      any more good, and waste bandwidth. On the Undernet you will probably
      never need more than one bot per channel. Also note that it&#39;s
      generally not acceptable to use a bot to &quot;keep a channel
      open&quot; when it&#39;s not in use. However, policies differ from net
      to net and server to server so check around before starting.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Bots <STRONG>
      CANNOT</STRONG> provide absolute protection. Nothing can. Eggdrop will
      try its hardest but there are no guarantees.</FONT></P>
