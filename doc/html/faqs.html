FOUND"?</font></strong></font> 

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">(1) Run Eggdrop with the "-m" option (i.e., "eggdrop -m mybot").</font><br>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">(2) Go to IRC and send "hello" to your bot (i.e., "/msg mybot hello").</font><br>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">(3) You will become an owner on your bot. You can leave the bot running (nobody else will become a master if they say "hello"), but in the future, don't use
the "-m" option when running the bot.</font></blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><a name="faq2"></a> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">2. MY EGGDROP WON'T RUN; IT JUST SAYS "CAN'T FIND YOUR
HOSTNAME!"</font></strong></font> 

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Your machine is set up strangely, and Eggdrop can't figure out its network hostname. You can get around
this by setting an environment variable called HOSTNAME.</font></font> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">In sh or ksh:</font></font></p>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">$ HOSTNAME=myhost.domain.edu</font><br>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">$ export HOSTNAME</font></font></blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">In csh or tcsh:</font></font> 

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">% setenv HOSTNAME myhost.domain.edu</font></font></blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">It should work after that. You may want to bug your system administrator to set up her /etc/hosts file correctly, or
add those above commands to your '.login' file (sh or ksh: '.profile').</font></font></blockquote>

 <a name="faq3"></a><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">3. WHAT THE HECK IS TCL?</font></strong></font></p>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Tcl is a scripting language written by John Ousterhout. It's much better than most "in-built" script
languages (like the one in ircII) and is meant to be linked with anything needing a script language. So I linked it with Eggdrop. The file "tcl-commands.doc" in the Eggdrop directory contains a list
of the commands added to Tcl by Eggdrop. There are also several example scripts in the scripts/ directory, and there are gobs of scripts floating around on the ftp sites if you like working by
example (which is typically the best way).</font></font></blockquote>

 <a name="faq4"></a><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">4. MY BOT DIES AND THE LAST ENTRY IN THE LOGFILE IS "RECEIVED TERMINATE SIGNAL". WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND CAN I
PREVENT IT?</font></strong></font></p>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">There's nothing you can do to prevent it. It means the system administrator is killing the Eggdrop process.
Most of the time, it's an automatic thing that happens when the system is being rebooted, so it's harmless. If you have a crontab running, the bot will get restarted when the system is back online.
Occasionally the system administrator will kill the bot manually -- for example, if he/she doesn't want bots running on the system.</font></font></blockquote>

 <a name="faq5"></a><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">5. MY COMPILE DIES AT THE LAST MINUTE WITH "LD FATAL SIGNAL 11"!</font></strong></font></p>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">This happens on Linux machines that have recently been converted to ELF by upgrading to Slackware 3.0.
Apparently Slackware 3.0 comes with a non-ELF (a.out) Tcl library, and the compiler doesn't handle that well. (It should give you an error; instead it barfs.) Fixing it is tricky because even if you
recompile libtcl.a, the linker will most likely find the "bad" one first, and your work will be in vain.</font></font> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Here's a fix that's been floating around on the Eggdrop list:</font></font></p>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">1. Recompile 'libtcl.a' for yourself, to make sure an ELF librar is created.</font><br>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">2. Copy it into your eggdrop/src directory, naming it 'libtcl2.a'.</font><br>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">3. Edit the Makefile and change the line that says '-L/usr/lib -ltcl' to '-L. -ltcl2'.</font><br>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">4. Recompile Eggdrop.</font></font></blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Also send hate-mail to the Slackware guy telling him to stop messing up the libraries. He seemed to assume that
everyone would still want to compile old-style (a.out) binaries.</font></font></blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><a name="faq6"></a> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">6. SOMEONE ELSE SET UP A BOT I DON'T LIKE. ARE THERE ANY BACKDOORS I CAN
USE TO TAKE THEIR BOT DOWN?</font></strong></font> 

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">No, there have never been any backdoors and there never will be, so please stop asking. Every once in a
while, someone finds a way to exploit a bug in Eggdrop, but we fix these bugs as soon as we find out about them. If you want to bring down someone else's bot, you will not have my/our
help.</font></font></blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><a name="faq7"></a> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">7. WHAT ARE MODULES?</font></strong></font> 

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Modules are a way of adding extra C code from the bot, much like Tcl scripts, without requiring the bot
recompiling, see doc/MODULES for more info.</font></font></blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><a name="faq8"></a> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">8. CAN I COMPILE EGGDROP WITHOUT DYNAMIC MODULES?</font></strong></font> 

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Yes, you can, if ./configure detects that your system CAN'T run modules it will setup 'make' to link the
modules in statically for you, you can also choose this option if you can do dynamic modules by typing 'make static'. You can also try to compile dynamic modules on a static-only system by typing
'make eggdrop'.</font></font> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><a name="faq8.1"></a> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">8.1 DO I STILL NEED TO 'loadmodule modules'
???</font></strong></font></p>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#000000">YES, when you compile statically, all the modules are linked into the main executable *but*
they are not enabled until you use loadmodule to enable then, hence you get nearly the same functionality with static modules as dynamic modules.</font></font></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><a name="faq9"></a> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">9. WHERE CAN I GET A PRECOMPILED EGGDROP FOR MY
COMPUTER?</font></strong></font> 

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">It is <strong>HIGHLY</strong> recommended <strong>AGAINST</strong> using precompiled Eggdrops from
untrusted sources. Eggdrop has been a regular target for hacking and crashing. Distribution of precompiled (binary) versions of Eggdrop are the easiest way of hackers to provide you with the easiest
(and most dangerous) way of gaining access to not only your bot, but to your computer account directly. Don't advertise your precompiled Eggdrop binary sites on the Eggdrop list either
=P</font></font></blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><a name="faq10"></a> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">10. I GET 'Makefile:3 :invalid operator' OR SOME-SUCH-THING WHEN I TRY TO
'make'</font></strong></font> 

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Try 'gmake'</font></font></blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><a name="faq11"></a> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">11. WHEN I 'tclsh scripts/weed &lt;userfile&gt; c' IT BARFS CHUNKS AT ME
AND DIES :(</font></strong></font> 

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">UPGRADE YOUR TCL, you are probably using Tcl 7.5 or earlier, some of the commands in weed require tcl7.6 to
run, so either upgrade it, or removing the offending lines from you userfile (those starting with '.' generally) and accept the loss of that data.</font></font></blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><a name="faq12"></a> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">12. I get "ld-elf.so.1: Shared object "libtcl80.so.1" not found" or
"eggdrop: error in loading shared libraries / libtcl8.1.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" when I try to start my bot.</font></strong></font> 

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">'./configure' is looking in the wrong place for Tcl; it looks like it compiled with one version of Tcl and
tries to load another. Maybe your sysadmin upgraded Tcl and didn't tell you. In that case, you should just need to recompile your bot.</font></font> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Or maybe when upgrading he didn't clean the old version of Tcl, and './configure' is looking for the files in the
wrong places, or trying to use different versions of tcl.h and libtcl*. Smack your admin and have him install Tcl properly ;) Or try to:</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">./configure --with-tcllib=&lt;path-to-tcl-lib&gt;&nbsp; --with-tclinc=&lt;path-to-tcl-inc&gt;</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">tell configure where to look for the Tcl files. try to look for them like:</font><br>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">for libtcl:</font></font></p>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">ls /usr/lib/libtcl*</font><br>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">ls /usr/local/lib/libtcl*</font></font></blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">for tcl.h:</font></font> 

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">ls /usr/include/tcl.h</font><br>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">ls /usr/local/include/tcl.h</font></font></blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">If everything else fails, try to install Tcl to your home dir ;) (Suggested by dw@Undernet,
dw@lixom.nu)</font></font></blockquote>

 <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><a name="faq13"></a> <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">13. I get a whole pile of "Unresolved symbol 'Tcl_AppendResult'" (or some

<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">POSSIBILITY B:</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Some of the standard libraries have been compiled for static linking only on your machine, you have 3
options:</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">(1) if it's your own machine, recompile TCL using dynamic linking by using './configure --enable-shared' when you
configure TCL (not the bot) and then remake, &mp; reinstall</font><br>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">(2) if it's not you machine, you make have to resort to 'make static' and 'make sinstall DESTDIR=&lt;dir&gt;' to make and install your bot.</font><br>
 <font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">(3) if you are of a more aggressive sense of mind, go beat the stuffing out of your admin for have lame static libraries :)</font></font></p>
