      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">The most important way you will
      communicate with your bot is through the party line. The party line is
      accessible via DCC chat or telnet. It&#39;s pretty much just a
      miniature lag-less IRC (see &quot;Botnet&quot; below), but it also
      consists of a console through which you can watch channel activity and
      give commands.</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">To enter the party line,
      just offer a DCC chat to your bot. It should ask for your password if
      you&#39;ve set one. If you haven&#39;t set one, be sure to do so, so
      that you can use the /msg &quot;ident&quot; command and other goodies
      that require some sort of security.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">The party line is actually
      split up into 200,000 &quot;channels&quot;. The console is available
      from each channel, but you can only talk to people who are on your
      current channel (just like IRC). Channel 0 is the main party line,
      while others are typically reserved for private conversations. Channels
      1-99,999 are botnet wide chat channels and any user joining that
      channel anywhere on the botnet will be able to chat with you, Channels
      *0-*99,999 are local bot-only channels, only people on the current bot
      you are on can chat to you on there channels.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Commands for the console
      start with a dot (.), similar to the slash (/) used for IRC. At any
      time you can type <EM> &quot;.help&quot;</EM> to get a list of the
      possible commands. To find out what a command does, use <EM>
      &quot;.help &lt;command&gt;&quot;</EM> -- for example, <EM> &quot;.help
      channel&quot;</EM>. This documentation&#39;s appendix has the on-line
      help files for you to browse at your leisure.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">When you&#39;re on the party
      line, anything you type that doesn&#39;t start with a dot is considered
      to be broadcast to everyone else, just like talking on a channel. You
      can change channels with the <EM>&quot;.chat&quot;</EM> command or even
      leave all channels with <EM>&quot;.chat off&quot;.</EM></FONT></P>
