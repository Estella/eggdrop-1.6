                              About Eggdrop

    Eggdrop was created around December 1993 to help stop the incessant
    wars on #gayteen. It spawned from another bot that was in the process of
    being written at the time called "Unrest". The purpose of Unrest was to
    answer help requests from other bots. The first public release was v0.6,
    and since then, it has grown into what you have before you.

    To use Eggdrop, you need:

      * Some sort of Unix account

      * A pretty good knowledge of IRC and Unix, including how to 
       compile programs, how to read, and what DCC chat is, at absolute
       minimum.

      * About 4-6 MB of disk space. The eggdrop tarball is about 4.8 MB
        unpacked.

      * Tcl -- Eggdrop cannot compile without Tcl installed on your
        shell.

    Before starting, ask yourself if you really need a bot. Most IRC
    servers allow only a handful of bots, and some forbid them outright. 
    The reason? Too many people run bots as "toys" or as a means of 
    destruction. If you want to use Eggdrop for destructive purposes, go
    ahead and erase this directory now. It's almost impossible to do 
    what you want with this bot.

    You should try to find at least one server that will allow you to run
    a bot. If you use an ISP (Internet Service Provider) that runs its own
    IRC server, check to make sure that bots are okay. If you're going to
    use a server somewhere else, read the MOTD (Message Of The Day) and find
    out what their bot policy is. Following the rules will go a long way
    toward making your bot accepted.

    Bots CANNOT provide absolute protection. Nothing can. Eggdrop will try its
    hardest, but there are no guarantees.
