          Wiktor    Concated the UPDATE files
          Eule      Using "JOIN 0" instead of explicitly leaving every channel.

|^Raven^| Fabian    DNS module failed to handle IP address 0.0.0.0 properly.
guruz/    Fabian    Detect id-channel-names used as channel names (e.g. added
Evo|ver             with .+chan) during IRC session.

                    output. Also slightly cleaned up irc.mod/cmdsirc.c.
ReBEL     guppy     Increased the length of ban reasons from 65 to 160 (I
                    think this is what RFC1459 allows for default).
          Fabian    Moved strncpyz() macro from server.mod to a global location.
TaKeDa    Eule      Restricted WHO stacking to add up to a maximum of MAXPENALTY
                    penalty seconds.
          Eule      Added channel specific aop-delay setting. Allows randomly
                    delayed auto-ops, auto-ops after a certain delay and the
                    current behaviour, i.e. immediate auto-op.
Eule      Fabian    Fixed IRC_DO_CHANNEL_PART call from channels.c.
Abraham   Fabian    Fixed compiler warnings about 'const' for tcl libraries
                    that don't declare Tcl_SetVar as taking const strings.

Tothwolf  Fabian    Could not remove joining channel from procs called by
                    JOIN bind.
fabulous  Fabian    The filesys module did not support remotely linked files.
                    Instead, the bot crashed in various places and didn't even
                    attempt to save/load the link information.
          Eule      Removed duplicate servlimit check from irc.mod.

                    from the stopnethack checks.
          Fabian    Minor cleanup of protocol in back-ground code.
          Fabian    Avoid data lossage during the start of connections, while
                    the receiving dcc functions aren't listening yet. So now
                    you can blindly start sending data right after connecting
                    and depend on the OS and eggdrop to do The Right Thing.
Abraham,  Fabian    Changed failure of socket() to non-fatal event.
TaKeDa
TheUnknown Fabian   Fixed support for SunOS / Solaris.
          Fabian    Don't actually delete the bind structures immediately, use
                    centralised garbage collector instead. Cleaned up various
                    aspects of the bind list handling.
Sup       Fabian    Don't insist on proper domainname during hostname detection.
Sup       Fabian    Properly call PART bind when removing channel and the bot
                    will therefore leave the channel shortly. Also slightly
                    reworked channel removal.
          Fabian    Move actual assert check back into macro, saving a
                    function call.
NigtHuntr Fabian    Removed small compile warning about ambigious if/else.
Abraham   Eule      Fixed and optimised ban/exempt and invite expiration code
                    for global and channel specific masks.
zart      Sup       DCC send and chat requests send to channels are now ignored.
          Looser^   Fixed typo in irc.mod/irc.h me_op export macro.
          Eule      Made the bot recognise modes during CHAN_PEND. Allows us to
                    properly recognise bans/other masks and call mode binds.
          Eule      Fixed get_user_by_host, which was broken for strict_host
                    set to 0.
          Eule      Slightly optimised gotnick() by replacing the call to
                    clear_chanlist() with a specialised loop.
labtec    guppy     Instead of telnet!*@* we now use -telnet!*@* since no valid
                    IRC nicknames can be prefixed with a dash (per RFC1459).
          Eule      Added proper logics to the user{bans,exempts,invites}
                    settings and removed the clearbansset setting.
Abraham/  Fabian    Small typo in ismember() (added during cleanup) caused
DennisMV            channel functions to freak out. Sigh.
          Cybah     flush_mode() cleanups. -{b,e,I} now sent before +{b,e,I}.
                    used egg_strcatn to make buffer-overflow free.
          Fabian    Fixed caching for Tcl configuration details. As soon as
                    different libraries are detected, we discard cached
                    values.
          SuperS    Cleaned up style for aclocal.m4 system handling. Added
                    support for SunOS4.
          Fabian    Caching -pipe test results for configure.
various  TheUnknown Fixed linking for Sparc with SunOS/BSD/Linux, which caused
                    the bot to crash under certain circumstances.
         TheUnknown Added use of the -pipe compiler option, to speed-up
                    compilation.

                    early-fork hack. Cleaner support will be possible in 1.7.
Wiktor    Fabian    Disabled cycling for +a !channels. Minor cleanups.
          Fabian    Minor optimizations in irc.mod:chan.c.
          Eule      Checking for m->user == NULL in kick_all() and

          guppy     Removed `SERVER SUPPORT LOADED' message.
Igmar     Fabian    Added missing checks around new_dcc() call. This prevents
                    the bot from crashing under high connection load.
          Cybah     Added egg_strcatn function.
          Eugene    Repositioned help-path setting in eggdrop.simple.conf so
                    that the modules actually load the help files.
FuzzBuster Fabian   Minor documentation fix to seen.mod help.

Kelvin              inactive channels, which the bot hadn't joined to yet.
Joker     Fabian    Fixed further places where +/-revengebot was not properly
                    integrated or documented.
          Fabian    Fixed eggdrop test-run for vpath. Using autoconf macros for
                    caching in aclocal.m4. Changed -L. to -L`pwd` for
                    libtcls < 7.4 support hack.
          Fabian    Added strftime compatibility function.
          Eule      Re-added bell character to note message. This can be
                    filtered out with the `.strip +g' command.
