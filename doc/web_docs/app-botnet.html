    <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">This document is designed to
    help you with a working knowledge of botnets.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">This document includes bot
    flags, sharing and linking bots.&nbsp; This only covers the&nbsp; 1.5.X
    version of Eggdrop.&nbsp; Many things have changed in the way flags are
    handled and the way user-files are shared.&nbsp; The code has been
    stream-lined and made more efficient.&nbsp; Even if you have used
    previous version you should still glance over this document to find out
    what changes have been made.&nbsp; It will take some time to get used to
    but you will see its all for the better.</FONT></P>

       <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Also the associated command(s)
      if applicable.</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><STRONG> Botnet</STRONG>:-
      The term used to describe multiple bots connected together.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><STRONG>
      Flags</STRONG>:-&nbsp; Flags are attributes that determine what a bot
      can and can&#39;t do. Flags can be either global or channel
      specific.&nbsp; The main ones that affect a botnet are +h(hub), +a(alt
      hub) +s(passive share), +s (channel share), +p (passive share), +g
      (global share).</FONT><BR>

        <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><STRONG> Aggressive
        Share</STRONG>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Term used to describe the method of

        Share</STRONG>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Term

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><STRONG>
      Relay</STRONG>:-&nbsp; The relay port number of the bot, if defined in
      the config file.&nbsp; If defined in the config file the bot will use
      two separate ports.&nbsp; One for telnet connections to other bots and
      one for relay connections.&nbsp; A relay connection is used to relay
      (jump) to another bot in DCC chat.&nbsp; You can still relay to another
      bot even if this is not defined in the config file.</FONT><BR>

    BOTS</FONT></STRONG> 

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">With the common terms out of
      the way we can start with the process of adding a bot so you may
      connect them together.&nbsp; Before you start you will need to decide
      or know the following:</FONT> 

      <OL>
        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Will it be a share
        bot?</FONT></LI>

        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Which bot is the hub (+h)
        bot?</FONT></LI>

        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Will there be a alternate
        hub (+a) bot?</FONT></LI>

        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">If sharing who gets what
        from whom?</FONT></LI>

        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">What are the domains and
        ports of the bots.</FONT></LI>
      </OL>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">*NOTE*:&nbsp; For sharing to
      work modules: transfer, share, filesys must be&nbsp; loaded on all the
      bots, and the channel specific +s should be set for all channels to be
      shared.</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">First off, let&#39;s say we
      have two bots we want to link.&nbsp; We will call one Lamestbot, and
      the other Lameshare.&nbsp; The first thing that needs to be done is
      each bot needs the other bot added to it&#39;s user record.&nbsp; Your
      botnet should have a hub bot.&nbsp; This will have them connect
      automatically whenever they are started.&nbsp; Without a hub you would
      have to manually link them with the .link command.&nbsp; For this
      situation we will make Lamestbot the hub for our small botnet.
      Let&#39;s also use a channel called #eggdrop as the one we want to
      share user channel flags with.&nbsp; Do the following:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">On Lamestbot:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">.+bot Lameshare
        eggdrop.com:3333 (This command adds a user record to Lamestbot for
        Lameshare.&nbsp; Lameshare is running from eggdrop.com and is on port
        3333. If Lameshare were to have a separate port for users/relays we
        would just add a &#39;/&#39; and the port number i.e.
        3333/5555)</FONT> 

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">.botattr Lameshare +s
        (this tells us that Lamestbot will only send user files to Lameshare,
        Lameshare will not send them to it)</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">.botattr Lameshare |s
        #eggdrop (this sets up sharing of the channel flags for #eggdrop
        between the bots. Without this they will not share channel flags only
        global flags for the users.)</FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">On Lameshare:</FONT> 

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">.+bot Lamestbot
        best.com:3333/5555 (Again this will add a user on Lameshare called
        Lamestbot with the domain of best.com.&nbsp; The bot has two ports,
        3333 for bot communications and 5555 for users/relays)</FONT> 

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">.botattr Lamestbot +hp
        (this command sets Lamestbot as the hub and also as a passive share
        which means Lameshare will accept user files from
        Lamestbot.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">.botattr Lamestbot |+s
        #eggdrop (again sets #eggdrop as a share channel and that channel
        flags will be passed to Lameshare from Lamestbot)</FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">At this point the bots should
      be auto-connecting and sharing between themselves.&nbsp; HINT:
      don&#39;t assign the +h flag until you are ready for them to
      link.&nbsp; Depending on the speed of the box they may connect
      prematurely before you have all the flags set.</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">

      Lameshare</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Let&#39;s add a third bot
      called beldin to this scenario:</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">On Lamestbot:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">.+bot beldin
        llama.com:3333</FONT> 

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">.botattr beldin s|s
        #eggdrop (notice how i piped (the | character) the channel flag also
        saving time.)</FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Also note that you don&#39;t
      have to add beldin on Lameshare since they are already sharing it was
      added automatically.&nbsp; The one thing that you should note though is
      that no bot flags will be shared.&nbsp; Meaning that if you set beldin
      as +s (Aggressive share) on the hub (Lamestbot) he will not be set on
      the other bots as that.&nbsp; The same with the channel +s flag.&nbsp;
      All other flags will be shared such as the o f etc..</FONT><BR>
       <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Now that we have three bots we
      can also set up one as an alternate hub.</FONT><BR>
       <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">The alternate hub is the bot
      that the bots will auto-connect to in the event the hub goes down and
      is unreachable.</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Let&#39;s make beldin an
      alternate hub for our little botnet</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">On Lameshare:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">.botattr beldin +a</FONT>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">That&#39;s all there is to
      it.&nbsp; Again since bot flags are not shared you would have to add
      the bot flag +a for beldin on them all.&nbsp; The only ones you would
      not have to do this on are beldin, and the hub (Lamestbot).&nbsp; Of
      course if you had more bots you would have to add beldin as a +a to
      them but you would not do it on the hub or beldin.</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Lamestbot (hub)___&lt; &gt;____Lameshare</FONT><BR>
       <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">

      |_____&lt; &gt;______beldin</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">That&#39;s about it for
      sharing, again you could add subsequent bots the same way you added
      beldin.</FONT><BR>
