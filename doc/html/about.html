      <p><strong>About Eggdrop</strong></p>
    </div>
    <hr>

    <p>Eggdrop was created around December 1993 to help stop the incessant
    wars on #gayteen. It spawned from another bot that was in the process of
    being written at the time called &quot;Unrest&quot;. The purpose of
    Unrest was to answer help requests from other bots. The first public
    release was v0.6, and since then, it has grown into what you have before
    you.</p>

    <p>To use Eggdrop, you need:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Some sort of Unix account</li>

        <li>A pretty good knowledge of IRC and Unix, including how to 
        compile programs, how to read, and what DCC chat is, at absolute
        minimum.</li>

        <li>About 4-6 MB of disk space. The eggdrop tarball is about 4.8 MB
        unpacked.</li>

        <li>Tcl -- Eggdrop cannot compile without Tcl installed on your
        shell.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Before starting, ask yourself if you really need a bot. Most IRC
    servers allow only a handful of bots, and some forbid them outright. 
    The reason? Too many people run bots as &quot;toys&quot; or as a means 
    of destruction. If you want to use Eggdrop for destructive purposes, go
    ahead and erase this directory now. It&#39;s almost impossible to do 
    what you want with this bot.</p>

    <p>You should try to find at least one server that will allow you to run
    a bot. If you use an ISP (Internet Service Provider) that runs its own
    IRC server, check to make sure that bots are okay. If you&#39;re going to
    use a server somewhere else, read the MOTD (Message Of The Day) and find
    out what their bot policy is. Following the rules will go a long way
    toward making your bot accepted.</p>

    <p>Bots <strong>CANNOT</strong> provide absolute protection. Nothing 
    can. Eggdrop will try its hardest, but there are no guarantees.</p>
