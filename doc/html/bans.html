      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">I assume that you know how bans
      work on IRC. Eggdrop handles bans and the 2 new modes, exemptions and
      invite in various ways, and this chapter is intended to help clarify
      how these modes are treated within the bot</FONT>

        <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica size=" color="#000000" size="-1" >This type of mode
        enables the person specified in the host mask to join the channel
        even if there is a ban in place matching their hostmask. Normally
        this is used if a domain ie. *.net is banned, and you want to enable
        someone from that domain to join i.e. *.friend.net. This list can
        only be viewed by channel ops.</FONT>

            about. They can be removed by anyone on the channel. The other

            style that Eggdrop sets by default, when a user uses one of the

            ban will be removed if using dynamic modes after a certain time.
            If a mode is <EM>&quot;sticky&quot;</EM> and you wish to set it

            active on the channel by the bot, even if the channel is set to
            use dynamic modes. Obviously, if the channel isn&#39;t set to use

          in place for at least exempt-time minutes (defined in config file)

      channel specific ban depending on the parameters that are passed to it.
      <EM> &quot;.kickban&quot;</EM> will add a channel-specific ban. <EM>
      &quot;.&lt;ban/exempt/invite&gt;s&quot;</EM> will list them all,
      according to their category. Be sure to check out the help pages for
