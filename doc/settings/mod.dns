##### DNS MODULE #####

This module provides asynchronous dns support. This will avoid long
periods where the bot just hangs there, waiting for a hostname to
resolve, which will often let it timeout on all other connections.

This module requires: none

Put this line into your eggdrop configuration file to load the dns module:

loadmodule dns
