This module provides very basic seen commands via msg, on channel or via dcc.
This module works only for users in the bot's userlist. If you are looking for
a better and more advanced seen module, try the gseen module by G'Quann. You
can find it at http://www.visions-of-fantasy.de/gseen.mod/.

This module requires: none

Put this line into your Eggdrop configuration file to load the seen
module:
