Here are some little tricks that you may or may not know about.

-  You can "lock" a user's info line by putting an '@' as the first letter.
   They won't be able to change it any more.

-  '.status all' will dump out virtually everything you have configured on
   your bot.

-  Tcl has a command 'info body <proc>' that will list the contents of a
   proc. 'info args <proc>' shows what you have defined as the parameters
   for the proc.

-  You can rename a built-in command by binding over it. To rename '.status'
   to '.report', you'd do:
     unbind dcc - status *dcc:status
     bind dcc m report *dcc:status

   The first line removes the built-in binding on '.status', and the second
   line binds '.report' to the built-in status function.  Other built-in command
   examples include:

     unbind msg - status *msg:status
     bind msg m report *msg:status

   Also:

     unbind fil - share *fil:share
     bind fil m link *fil:share

-  You can unlink all bots and clear out the botnet info from memory by
   using '.unlink *'. It erases all channel assoc's and everything.

-  You can automatically make a ban sticky by adding a * as the first
   character in the ban reason.

-  You can add a user with a static hostmask when using .adduser by prefixing
   their nick with '!'.

        For example, with a hostmask of drummer!ident@some.host.com:

                .adduser drummer
                        Hostmask: *!ident@*.host.com
                .adduser !drummer
                        Hostmask: *!ident@some.host.com

- If you don't want your logfiles to be deleted after two days and
  don't want the bot to create a new logfile each new day, then set
  'keep-all-logs' to 0 and 'switch-logfiles-at' to 2500 in your bot
  config file to make it keeping one logfile all the time. However,
  this is not recommended on high traffic channels.

- You can modify Eggdrop's output in the partyline, kick messages,
  and other texts by editing core.english.lang in the language directory.

As your botnet grows bigger, and you have to maintain more and more bots
with their config files, you might render these little tweaking tips useful:

- Config file split:
    You can export parts of your config file to separate files. For example,
    if you have several config files which differ from themselves only by
    the nickname and the used servers, you can export them to an own file
    and link it with the 'source' Tcl command, similar to a script. The
    advantage of this is that you have to edit/upload only the small file
    instead of the big one. This technique is also useful if you want to
    maintain the same channel settings, etc.

- Variable usage in the config file:
  You can use variables in your config file, since it's really just a plain
  Tcl file. For example, you can set 'userfile' and 'chanfile' to "yourbot.user"
  and "yourbot.chan" using the following method:

  set myvar "yourbot"
  set userfile "$myvar.user"
  set chanfile "$myvar.chan"
