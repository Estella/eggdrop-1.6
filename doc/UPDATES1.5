daimonic  Wiktor    made some doc/ and README improvements
          Wiktor    Now doesn't remove bogus bans set by masters anymore.
          Jason     Moved web_docs to html to keep proper naming
          Tothwolf  Added textfile substitutions to web based docs.
          Jason/Toth updated webdocs to include config file settings. Includes

drnet     Fabian    prefixes to source filenames caused trouble in memory
                      debugging functions.
Wiktor    Fabian    compress and uncompress functions now check whether the
                      passed filenames are actually real files.  tcl commands

          Fabian    Cleaned up language load messages. Most are now moved to
                      debug level. Each "Module loaded:" message also states

                      in language entries. tcl_language is depreciated.
Phoenix   Fabian    resume support in the transfer module was not compatible
                      with mircs implementation. mirc would also do some silly

Wiktor    Fabian    fixed minor memory leak in transfer module.
          Wiktor    renamed .nick and .chnick to .handle and .chhandle. Fixed

          Fabian    Makefile and configure adjustments. vpath now works.
various   Fabian/   Added a src/compat directory with functions needed by
          Tothwolf    eggdrop, but not provided by all systems.

                      use user definable channel flags.
          drummer   DNS related relay fixes. Added new socket flag SOCK_VIRTUAL
                      to stop not yet valid sockets from being accessed in the

Wiktor    Fabian    minor Makefile fixes. minor config.status tweaks.
          Fabian    misc aclocal.m4 changes. misc/modconfig now keeps track of
                      known modules. unknown modules are automatically selected
                      on running `make config' / `make iconfig'. `make
                      new-iconfig' only asks questions about newly added mods.
TheQ      Fabian    increased portability of src/mod/eggautoconf
Lucas     Fabian    renamed aux/ to misc/ to avoid problems on win32
Wiktor    Fabian    module names are now correctly distinguished (e.g. bseen

          Fabian    minor fixes to the filesys module
          Jason     Modified .+host so normal users could use it to add hosts
                      to their own record as they can already use .-host. Only
                      allows hosts that don't match other users.
toot      Fabian    added module `compress' which allows compressed user file
                      sending; based on zlib

          Fabian    configure supports `--disable-mod-MODULE' to disable
                      specific modules and `make reconfig' allows you to select
                      modules interactively.
