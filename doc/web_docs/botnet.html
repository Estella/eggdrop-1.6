    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">People starting up an Eggdrop
      bot for the first time are usually confused about the
      &quot;botnet&quot; support -- i.e., the ability to link two or more
      bots together and have them merge party lines, and form a sort of
      miniature IRC.</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">In order to link to other
      bots, your bot needs to have a telnet port defined in the config file.
      The default is usually something like 2222 or 3333, but it&#39;s wise
      to choose something else, especially if a lot of other people are using
      the same machine. If other Eggdrop bots are running from that machine,
      try to pick telnet ports at least 5-10 apart.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Sometimes you will specify a
      port, like 3333, but that&#39;s not available when Eggdrop starts up.
      On most operating systems, it just means the port was in use recently
      (probably by your bot!) and it hasn&#39;t had time to reset it yet. So
      Eggdrop will try 3334, and maybe even 3335, until it gets one. Other
      bots are aware of this, and when they try to connect, if the specified
      port (3333 in this example) doesn&#39;t work, they&#39;ll try the next
      few before giving up. If you have one bot on 3333, and another on 3334,
      they will always be bumping into each other, and other bots will get
      confused. That&#39;s bad.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">When you first connect two
      bots together, you need to tell each bot about the other one. To do
      this, use the &quot;+bot&quot; command. You need to know:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <UL>
          <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">the nickname of the
          other bot, like &#39;Lamestbot&#39;</FONT></LI>

          <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">the hostname, like
          &#39;maverick.math.uic.edu&#39;</FONT></LI>

          <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">the telnet port
          it&#39;s using, like 2222 or 3454</FONT></LI>
        </UL>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">The format of the
      &#39;+bot&#39; command is:</FONT> 

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <EM><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">.+bot &lt;nickname&gt;
        &lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</FONT></EM>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">This creates a &quot;bot
      record&quot; for the bot, in your userfile. It&#39;s kind of like a
      user record, but a little different. For example, Lamestbot, running
      from connected.com on port 3454, would be:</FONT> 

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <EM><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">.+bot Lamestbot
        connected.com:3454</FONT></EM>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Now to connect the bots, one of
      you (but not both!) needs to type:</FONT> 

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <EM><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">.link
        &lt;botname&gt;</FONT></EM>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">The first time two bots
      connect, they set a password for each other, so that after that, nobody
      can &quot;fake&quot; a connection between the two. You can reset that
      password later with the command:</FONT> 

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <EM><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">.chpass
        &lt;botname&gt;</FONT></EM>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">The bot record is like a user
      record except for two things:</FONT> 

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <UL>
          <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">If you share userfiles
          with another bot (see below), only user records are shared. The bot
          records will stay on this bot only.</FONT></LI>

          <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">There are special flags
          that can be set for bots, which can&#39;t be set for
          users.</FONT></LI>
        </UL>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">The special flags you can set
      for bots are:</FONT> 

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">h
        (hub):</FONT></STRONG><BR>
         <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Your bot will try about once
        a minute to link to a hub bot, until it succeeds. Once it&#39;s
        linked to one hub, it will no longer try to connect to others.</FONT>
        

        <P><STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">a
        (alternate):</FONT></STRONG><BR>
         <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">If no hub bots can be
        linked, your bot will try to link to one of these instead. Once one
        alternate bot is linked, it won&#39;t try to connect any others --
        although it will still try to link to hub bots. If a hub bot connects
        later, any alternate bot could be dropped.</FONT></P>

        <P><STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">s
        (share):</FONT></STRONG><BR>
         <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">This means that the bot is
        sharing user records aggressively.</FONT></P>

        <P><STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">p
        (passive):</FONT></STRONG><BR>
         <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">This means that the bot is
        to share user records passively with this bot.</FONT></P>

        <P><STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">l
        (leaf):</FONT></STRONG><BR>
         <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">If a bot is marked as a
        leaf, that means you don&#39;t want it to link any other bots behind
        it. In other words, it can only be connected to the botnet in one
        place, and no other bots may be connected through it.</FONT></P>

        <P><STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">r
        (reject):</FONT></STRONG><BR>
         <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Any bot that has this flag
        will not be permitted on the botnet at all, no matter where it
        connects. This is equivalent to an IRC&#39;s
        &quot;Q-line&quot;.</FONT></P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">There are also 10 user-defined
      flags (0-9) available for use with bots only.</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><STRONG> N.B.</STRONG>:
      There&#39;s a full explanation of these flags and how to use them in
      the section called <EM> &quot;Userfile Sharing&quot;.</EM></FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">These flags can all be
      changed by the &#39;.botattr&#39; command just like for users. For
      example:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <EM><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">.botattr Valis
        +sh</FONT></EM>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">There are several chains of
      connected bots out there. See the &#39;nets&#39; file for a list of the
      various botnets around. If the flags above seem confusing, don&#39;t
      worry. Usually the only one you need to worry about is the +h flag. And
      most botnets have a policy about what flags you should set when hooking
      in, and they&#39;ll tell you what to set.</FONT>
