###  %bassoc%b
   This displays a list of current botnet channel names.

%{+t}
###  %bassoc%b [<[*]channel number> <name>]
   This creates a name for a channel. The name will propagate across the botnet
   and can be used instead of the channel number when changing chat channels.
   If the channel number is prefixed with a '*', the association will only take
   place for the local channel, and will not be sent out over the botnet. If
   you omit the channel number and name, it will dump a list of the current
   named channels. If you omit just the name, the association will be removed.
