This document contains tweaking tips for your config file.

As your botnet grows bigger, and you have to maintain more and more bots
with their config files, you might render these little tweaking tips useful.
They can make your life configuring, maintaining and adding of bots a lot
easier.

- Config file split:
    You can export parts of your config file to separate files. For example,
    if you have several config files which differ from themselves only by 
    the nickname and the used servers, you can export them to an own file 
    and link it with the 'source' Tcl command, similar to a script. The 
    advantage of this is that you have to edit/upload only the small file 
    instead of the big one. This technique is also useful if you want to 
    maintain the same channel settings, etc.

- Variable usage in the config file:
  You can use variables in your config file, since it's really just a plain 
  Tcl file. For example, you can set 'userfile' and 'chanfile' to "yourbot.user" 
  and "yourbot.chan" using the following method:

  set myvar "yourbot"
  set userfile "$myvar.user"
  set chanfile "$myvar.chan"
