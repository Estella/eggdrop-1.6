      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">People on IRC are recognized by
      the bot according to their user@host. That is, if I am on IRC
      as:</FONT> 

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <EM><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">*** [Kirk] is
        ikaney@uk.defiant.org (Fortune favors the bold.)</FONT></EM>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">then Eggdrop will identify me
      according to &quot;ikaney@uk.defiant.org&quot; and not by my nickname.
      I can change nicknames at will and it won&#39;t forget me.</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">For convenience, it&#39;s
      useful to have a &quot;handle&quot; which always identifies the same
      person. Usually the &quot;handle&quot; is just whatever nickname some-
      one was using when the bot first learned them. The nickname you had
      when you first said &quot;hello&quot; to Eggdrop is the handle it will
      know you by, regardless of whatever nickname you may be using at a
      given time.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Because of this, only one
      person can have a given handle on your bot. Masters can change it, and
      anyone with party-line access can change their own handle, but it&#39;s
      intended to be something stable -- unlike nicknames on IRC which are
      about as stable as Jello.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Eggdrop likes to store a lot
      of information about each user. The most important thing stored is the
      list of hostmasks that a user is recognized by. You can add a new
      hostmask with the /msg &quot;ident&quot; command. Masters can add and
      remove hostmasks with the party-line commands &quot;.adduser&quot;,
      &quot;.+host&quot;, and &quot;.-host&quot;.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Other things that are stored
      include the user&#39;s flags (see <STRONG> &quot;Access Levels? No,
      Flags&quot;</STRONG> section), the last time he/she was on a channel,
      an optional comment, their current directory in the file area, an info
      line which can be displayed when they join a channel, and possibly even
      some other things that Tcl scripts store.</FONT></P>
