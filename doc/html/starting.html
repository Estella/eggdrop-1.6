    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Obviously the first thing you
      want to do is compile the bot. The README file tells you what to do and
      answers some frequently-asked questions about compiling. If you&#39;re
      in a rush and you know what you&#39;re doing, you don&#39;t have to
      read this at all -- the README file tells you how to quickly compile
      and start up the bot.</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">If you&#39;ve read this far,
      then, I&#39;ll assume you have successfully compiled Eggdrop and edited
      the config file.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">First of all, Eggdrop has
      some command-line options -- not many, because most things should be
      defined through the config file. However sometimes you may want to
      start up the bot in a different mode, and the command-line options let
      you do that. Basically, the command line for Eggdrop is:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <EM><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">% eggdrop &lt;options&gt;
        &lt;config-file&gt;</FONT></EM>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">The options available
      are:</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">-n Don&#39;t background.
      Normally Eggdrop will move itself into the background when you start it
      up, meaning you&#39;ll get another shell prompt and you can do other
      things while the bot is going. With -n, you won&#39;t return to the
      shell prompt until the bot exits (which won&#39;t normally happen until
      it&#39;s killed). By default, -n will send all log entries to the
      console.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">-nt Don&#39;t background,
      use terminal. This is just like -n, except that instead of seeing log
      entries, your console will simulate a DCC chat with the bot.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">-nc Don&#39;t background,
      show channel info. This is just like -n, except that instead of seeing
      log entries, every 10 seconds your screen will clear and you will see
      the current channel status, sort of like &quot;top&quot;.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">-m Create userfile. If you
      don&#39;t have a userfile, this will make Eggdrop create one, and give
      master/owner status to the first person that introduces himself or
      herself to it. You&#39;ll need to do this when you first set up your
      bot, and never again.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">-v Show version info, then
      quit.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Most people never use any of
      the options except -m, and you only need to use that once.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">It&#39;s <STRONG>
      STRONGLY</STRONG> recommended to run your bot from its own directory.
      That way upgrading to a new version is somewhat painless, and you
      won&#39;t have any troubles from language files and the like being in
      the wrong location. You can put your config file and user file in that
      directory, and then when you compile a new version of Eggdrop, you just
      have to do:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <EM><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">make install=DEST
        &lt;directory&gt;</FONT></EM>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">and it will copy all the
      necessary files.</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">The config file that comes
      with Eggdrop is called &quot;eggdrop.conf.dist&quot;. You need to edit
      that file and change almost everything. It specifies the bot&#39;s
      nickname, server list, and pretty much everything else about how your
      bot will work. You should also rename it from &quot;eggdrop.conf&quot;
      to something resembling your bot&#39;s name, for convenience. I call
      mine &quot;sisko&quot; since my bot is &quot;Sisko&quot;.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">You can execute the script
      to start the bot. For example, I use:</FONT></P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <EM><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">chmod u+x
        sisko</FONT></EM>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">to make the &quot;sisko&quot;
      script executable. Then I edited the first line of the script to
      say:</FONT> 

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <EM><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"> #!./eggdrop</FONT></EM>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">which tells the operating
      system which program to run when executing this script. (Obviously, it
      needs to run Eggdrop.) If you&#39;re too lazy to do this, or just
      don&#39;t feel like it, you can still start up your bot this
      way:</FONT> 

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <EM><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">eggdrop &lt;options&gt;
        &lt;config-file&gt;</FONT></EM>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">For example:</FONT> 

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <EM><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">eggdrop -nt
        sisko</FONT></EM>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">After you&#39;ve edited your
      config file and set the directories up the way you want them, start the
      bot with the -m option. That will make it create a user file. As soon
      as you&#39;ve started up the bot, you need to go to IRC and introduce
      yourself to the bot. Typically this is done by sending it the /msg
      &quot;hello&quot;, although many people change that greeting to
      something else (read the config file for more info about that).</FONT> 

      <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">When started with the -m
      option, the first person to introduce themselves to the bot will become
      the master/owner. You want to be that person. Once you are recognized
      as the owner, you have full access to the commands and abilities of the
      bot.</FONT></P>
