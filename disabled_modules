# Note:
#   -  Lines which start with a '#' character are ignored.
#   -  There should be no spaces infront or behind the module name:
#        `dns'       is valid.
#        `  dns  '   is invalid!
#   -  Every module name needs to be on its own line

# Woobie only serves as an example for module programming. No need to
# compile it for normal bots ...
