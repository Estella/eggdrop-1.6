    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Shown below are some messages
      that Eggdrop might log from time to time that are a bit strange and
      don&#39;t make it really that obvious what it&#39;s harping on
      about:</FONT> 

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">(!) timer drift --
        spun N minutes</FONT></STRONG>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">This is caused by one of
      several known things..</FONT> 

      <UL>
        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Your bot was swapped out
        of memory for a while, or that for some reason the computer stopped
        letting the bot run. Once a minute, Eggdrop does a few maintanance
        things, including counting down any Tcl timers you have going. If for
        some reason, several minutes pass without Eggdrop getting to do this,
        it logs this message to let you know what happened. It&#39;s
        generally a bad thing, because it means that the system your bot is
        on is very busy, and the bot can hardly keep track of the channel
        very well when it gets swapped out for minutes at a time.</FONT></LI>

        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">On some systems (at least
        Linux) if the dns your bot is using to lookup hostnames is broken,
        and *very* slow in responding (this can occur if the dns&#39;s uplink
        doesn&#39;t exist) then you will get 4/5 minute time drifts
        continuously, not much can be done about this, it&#39;s an operating
        system problem :(</FONT></LI>

        <LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">The clock on your machine
        has just been changed (e.g. it was running behind by several minutes
        and was just corrected)</FONT></LI>

        <BLOCKQUOTE>
          <STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">(!)
          killmember(Nickname) -&gt; nonexistant</FONT></STRONG>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>
        <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">We have yet to track this
        down. It&#39;s a mildly bad thing, though. It means the bot just got
        informed by the server that someone left the channel -- but the bot
        has no record of that person ever being ON the channel.</FONT> 

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">
        jwilkinson@mail.utexas.edu had some insight into this one:</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">This is not an Eggdrop
        bug, at least not most of the time. This is a bug in all but perhaps
        the very latest ircd systems. It&#39;s not uncommon during netsplits
        and other joins for the server to lose track of killed or collided
        join notices. Also, in some servers, it is possible to specify
        non-standard characters, such as carret symbols, which get falsely
        interpreted as capital letters.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">When converted to
        lowercase, these symbols fail to get processed, and joins are not
        reported, although parts are.</FONT></P>
