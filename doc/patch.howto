I. ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT

  The purpose of this document is to show you what a patch is and how you
  can apply a patch.


II. TERMS USED

  The following are some common terms used in this document.
  If applicable, there is also the associated command named.
  
   patch
    A patch is an update for a sourcecode of a program (here eggdrop). Be
    careful, every patch is designed for a special eggdrop version and
    cannot be applied on every bot!


III. APPLYING A PATCH

  To apply a patch to an eggdrop, you have to first obtain the eggdrop
  sourcecode. You should always keep a tar.gz archive with the source of 
  your current eggdrop on your shell. In the next step, you have to change 
  to your source directory (i.e.: /home/user/eggdrop1.6.0/) and type
  the following command:

  patch -p1 < ../path.to.the/patch

  Once this is complete, execute the following command:

  find . -name "*.rej" -print

  If it returns a list with filenames ending with .rej extension, then the
  patch didn't apply properly. Ensure that the patch is intended for your
  version and that you have the original source. You should also try to
  re-download the patch to ensure that the patch is not corrupted.

  If the patch applied properly, the only thing left to do is to recompile
  your eggdrop and install the new modules and binaries.


IV. CREATING AND SUBMITTING A PATCH

  If you fixed a bug and changed something in eggdrop's source code, it would
  be really nice to let the dev team know about it, so they can possibly apply 
  it to next release of eggdrop.

  There are several steps to submit a patch to the eggdev team:

  1. Create a directory with original source tree and one with modified source tree.

  2. Run 'diff -bur eggdrop1.6.original eggdrop1.6.modified > patchname.patch'. If
     your changes created any new files, use 'diff -burN' instead.

  3. Send an email to patches@eggheads.org with the patch attached. The body should
     contain a detailed description of what you changed and why you changed it. Don't 
     forget to include the botversion for which your patch was made. Also, please send 
     a second email with same info to eggdev@eggheads.org, this time without the patch 
     attached.


  Please, never patch src/patch.h or one of the UPDATES files. We will do it.
  Thank you.
