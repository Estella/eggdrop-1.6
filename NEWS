Well, after downloading new version of eggdrop you migth wonder what has changed
since the last version you used. Please note, that this in not an complete
updates file, it just covers the main and important changes. For a complete list
of all changes in 1.5 please see doc/UPDATES1.5

After you've read this document it might be also usefull for you to read INSTALL,
README, BOTNET, MODULES and tcl-commands.doc so you will be up-to-date. Please
note that we wont give you any support if you haven't even looked at them (most
problems are covered by them).



So, now, what's new?
--------------------

Since Eggdrop 1.4.x

!CHANNELS
Support for IRCNET !channels was added to eggdrop. Also this might be still a bit
buggy, it should work basically. We appreciate bug reports!

ASYNCHRONOUS DNS MODULE
Eggdrop 1.5.1 is shipped with a new module, the dns module. It replaces those old
ns-lookups performed by eggdrop which could halt the whole bot during a time-out.
We also added a new tcl command 'dnslookup', so scripts can look up IP's and
hostname now asynchronously, too.

+/-NODESYNCH
This new channel setting replaces the old 'allow-desync' setting from global to
channel functionality. This setting is usefull if you use some kind of chanserv
or if you don't care about your channel being desnych.

NICK LENGTH
To support longer nicknames as some irc servers do (dalnet I think) a settings was
added for this one (nick-len).

PENALTY CALCULATION
Eggdrop calculates penalty points on IRCNET now, so it won't flood itself off anymore.

SHARE MODULE
Share module got a new setting now (override-bots) which allows hub bots to
override the leafs bot setting (botadress, telnet port and password). Please note,
that this won't work with a 1.4 or even 1.3 bot.

TCL COMMANDS
* All three commands to add stuff to the queus (puthelp, putserv and putquick)
  support the '-next' parameter now which pushes data to the front of the queues.
* An command to calculate md5 checksums was added (md5).
* To support the new asynch dns module, the command 'dnslookup' was added.

TRAFFIC ACCOUNTING
Eggdrop counts the whole traffic which it generates and receives through irc,botnet and
dcc now. You can access these statistica via the dcc command '.traffic'. Please
note, that the counter gets reset every time a restart is done.

TRANSFER / FILESYS MODULE
The filesys and transfer modules have changed completely. Both can handle now
unlimited filename lengths and description sizes. Incomplete downloads from the
bot can be resumed now.
The db format of the filesys module was also changed to remove the limits imposed
by the old format. There's nothing special for you to do as the old db is
automatically converted to the new format when you first access it. You won't be
able to downgrade to older versions after this though, so maybe you'll want to
make a backup first.
