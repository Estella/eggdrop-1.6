     EGGDROP -- AN IRC BOT 

    <P>Eggdrop is the most advanced IRC robot available. It has been under
    development since December 1993, and, unlike most other bots, it is still
    regularly updated. Its features include:<BR>
     &nbsp;</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>completely different channel user lists like having a separate bot
      for each channel.</LI>

      <LI>complete channel protection, customizable via config file:
      permanently store a ban list with comments, etc</LI>

      <LI>user records saved on disk and alterable via dcc chat: each user
      can have a password (encrypted), a list of valid hostmasks, a set of
      access flags, etc</LI>

      <LI>the ability to &quot;learn&quot; new users (if you choose to have
      the bot do so) by letting users /MSG the bot &quot;hello&quot; and
      granting them automatic access of whatever type you specify (or even no
      access at all)</LI>

      <LI>a &quot;party line&quot; available through dcc chat or telnet, with
      multiple channels, giving you the ability to talk to people without
      being affected by netsplits</LI>

      <LI>console mode: you can view each channel through dcc chat or telnet,
      selectively looking at mode changes, joins and parts, channel talk, or
      any combination of the above</LI>

      <LI>a file system where people can upload and download files, in an
      environment that looks and acts (for the most part) like a typical Unix
      system -- plus the ability to mark directories as hidden / unaccessible
      to people without certain user flags</LI>

      <LI>bot network: link two or more bots together for a party line that
      can stretch not only across channels, but across IRC networks (one bot
      on EFnet, one bot on Undernet, etc)</LI>

      <LI>script language: commands and features can be added to the bot on
      the fly, by means of the TCL script language, giving you the power of
      TOTAL customization of your bot -- similar to ircII script</LI>
    </UL>

    <P><BR>
     !!! WARNING !!!</P>

    <P>Eggdrop is NOT a simple bot to use. It is an advanced bot for people
    who know IRC and know what they&#39;re doing. If you don&#39;t know what
    DCC CHAT is or how to use it -- if you don&#39;t know the difference
    between #channels and &amp;channels -- if you don&#39;t know what a clone
    bot or CTCP avalanche is -- then this bot is not for you. Choose a
    simpler bot like Vladbot or Baloobot or ComBot, or find one of the many
    scriptbots to use.</P>

    <P>This is the 1.5.xx branch of the Eggdrop Bot.</P>

    <P>*** NOTE:</P>

    <P>This bot is NOT intended for users of very limited MEMORY or DISK
    shell accounts. The development of this latest design of Eggdrop is
    geared towards features and flexibility. If you have restraints on the
    resources allowed to run your bot, then you should instead consider the
    1.0 Eggdrop version.</P>

    <P>***</P>

    <P>This latest development of Eggdrop is now compilable in either of two
    configurations:</P>

    <P>MODULE - dynamic</P>

    <P>The MODULE version of Eggdrop 1.5.xx provides for the on-the-fly
    loading of extensions to the bot code without having to recompile the
    entire bot. This is available on OS platforms which support dynamically
    linked/shared libraries in their run-time and TCL libraries. It allows
    for functionality of the bot to be loaded and unloaded at any time.</P>

    <P>The base loadable modules distributed with this Eggdrop version
    are:<BR>
     &nbsp;</P>

    <UL>
      <LI><STRONG>assoc</STRONG> This is the functionality of the `assoc&#39;
      command for naming party `chat&#39; lines. It also serves as an example
      for writing your own modules.</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>blowfish</STRONG> The standard Eggdrop encrypting routines
      for passwords and other encryptions. This can be replaced with a
      user-written module to perform their own encrypting algorithms.</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>channels</STRONG> This allows Eggdrop to have channel info
      stored and used on that server that you allowed for with the server
      module</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>compress</STRONG> This allows compression of the userfile
      saving disk space, and bandwidth when sending large userfiles to share
      bots..</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>console</STRONG> This provides storage of console settings
      when you exit the bot (or .store).</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>dns</STRONG> This provides asynchronous DNS lookups,
      avoiding the problem of the bot stalling while dns lookups are
      performed.</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>ctcp</STRONG> This provides the normal ctcp replies that
      you&#39;d expect.</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>filesys</STRONG> This module performs the file-system
      operation for DCC file transfers to and from the BOT over via IRC DCC
      commands.</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>irc</STRONG> This controls all other IRC related stuff. Not
      loading it is the equivalent of the old NO_IRC setting.</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>notes</STRONG> This provides support for storing of notes
      for users from each other. Notes between currently online users is
      supported in the core, this is only for storing the notes for later
      retrieval, direct user-&gt;user notes are built-in.</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>seen</STRONG> This provides seen commands via msg, on
      channel or via dcc, similar to the various scripts.</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>server</STRONG> This allows Eggdrop to connect to a server,
      but that&#39;s about it.</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>share</STRONG> This provides the userfile sharing support
      (this requires the channels &amp; transfer modules).</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>transfer</STRONG> This module performs the bot-to-bot
      userfile sharing necessary for share bots. It is loaded automatically
      when filesys is loaded.</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>wire</STRONG> This provides an encrypted party line
      communication.</LI>

      <LI><STRONG>woobie</STRONG> This is a example/skeletal module for
      writing your own module.</LI>
    </UL>

    <P><BR>
     MODULE - static</P>

    <P>The STATIC-MODULE version of Eggdrop 1.5.xx is pretty much the same as
    the module bot, except each individual module is linked into the
    executable. You still need to &#39;loadmodule &lt;module&gt;&#39; to turn
    them on.</P>

    <P>See the file MODULES for more specific MODULE information.<BR>
     New to 1.5.xx (applies to 1.4.xx also):</P>

    <P>**** BOTNET</P>

    <P>Major protocol changes, lots less messages &amp; bytes used.</P>

    <P>You WILL get double messages if you link
    OLD&lt;-&gt;NEW&lt;-&gt;NEW&lt;-&gt;OLD (or any number of NEW&#39;s
    between them).<BR>
     To prevent this, have all your new bots on 1 side of the botnet, and all
    the old ones on the other (although OLD&lt;-&gt;NEW&lt;-&gt;OLD should be
    ok).</P>

    <P>The order of the version and handshake messages has reversed this
    means on a new botlink between an OLD &amp; a NEW, but you must .link
    from the OLD or the NEW wont know the password.</P>

    <P>**** USERLIST</P>

    <P>If you want to have the option of going back to an old version SAVE
    your userlist!! This is a new version userlist, and it&#39;s not
    backwards compatible once written (it can still READ old userlists take
    note).</P>

    <P>**** FLAGS</P>

    <P>Flags have multiplied &amp; split up: normal user/channel flags still
    exist and are setable by .chattr. You can also now use .chattr +o|-o
    #channel. New are the &quot;user-defined&quot; flags which are all of A-Z
    for users &amp; channels. Also, bot attributes are separated now and are
    set using .botattr. Bots have &quot;user-defined&quot; flags 0-9. The old
    0-9 user defined flags will be converted to A-J when you upgrade your
    userfile.</P>

    <P>**** SHARING</P>

    <P>*BIG CHANGE* well, big in use, small in code ;)</P>

    <P>There are now 2 sharing flags, +p = passive share, +s = aggressive
    share. Your bot will only accept sharing with passively with 1 bot at a
    time, although any number of aggressive shares is fine.</P>

    <P>Consider the botnet:</P>

    <P>HubBotA<BR>
     |-+LeafBotA<BR>
     `-+HubBotB<BR>
     |-+LeafBotB<BR>
     `-or `-+LeafBotC</P>

    <P>Flags would be set as such:</P>

    <P>HubBotA has:<BR>
     LeafBotA: +sl<BR>
     HubBotB : +s<BR>
     LeafBotC: +sl<BR>
     LeafBotA has:<BR>
     HubBotA : +ph<BR>
     HubBotB has:<BR>
     LeafBotB: +sl<BR>
     LeafBotC: +sl<BR>
     LeafBotB has:<BR>
     HubBotB : +ph<BR>
     LeafBotC has:<BR>
     HubBotB : +ph<BR>
     HubBotA : +ph</P>

    <P>how&#39;s that look? :)</P>

    <P>**** Installation</P>

    <P>make install DEST=&lt;directory&gt;</P>
