    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Eggdrop does not have access
      levels like some bots. There are no meaningless numbers or titles.
      Instead, each user has &quot;flags&quot; that entitle them to certain
      privileges. Think of a flag as a badge. Any user can have any number of
      flags -- you can have no flags, or you can have all of them. Some flags
      are good, some are bad. Each flag is identified by a letter. The
      standard global flags are:</FONT>

      flags numbered A-Z (capitals). Bots can have specific flags which are
      explained later on. The channel flags for the bot are: <EM>(these can
