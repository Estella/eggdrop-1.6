Foundby   Fixedby   What....
	  G`Quann   added penalty calculation for all commands sent to the
		    irc server to prevent flooding (IRCnet specific)
	  rtc       reintroduced the text/-dir, renamed telnet-banner to
		    banner, set default config filename to eggdrop.conf,
		    put logfiles to logs/-dir by default
guppy	  Fabian    numerical hostnames are now detected
	  Fabian    outgoing bot links weren't correctly initialised, autolink
		    wasn't detecting active bot links and the dns module was
		    still broken from the last byte order changes
G`Quann	  Fabian    was deleting socket 0 if server connect failed
arthur2	  Fabian    the dcc[].addr is now consistently host byte order and
		    all async dns lookup functions accept host byte order IPs
	  Fabian    added an asynchronous DNS request module which prevents
		    the bot from hanging on dns lookups.
