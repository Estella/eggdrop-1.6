    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Support for IRCNET !channels
      was added to eggdrop. Also this might be still a bit buggy, it should
      work basically. We appreciate bug reports!</FONT>

    <STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color=
    "#FF0000">ASYNCHRONOUS DNS MODULE</FONT></STRONG> 

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Eggdrop 1.5.1 is shipped with a
      new module, the dns module. It replaces those old dns-lookups performed
      by eggdrop which could halt the whole bot during a time-out. We also
      added a new Tcl command &#39;dnslookup&#39;, so scripts can look up
      IP&#39;s and hostname now asynchronously, too.</FONT>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">This new channel setting
      replaces the old &#39;allow-desync&#39; setting from global to channel
      functionality. This setting is useful if you use some kind of chanserv
      or if you don&#39;t care about your channel being desnych.</FONT>

      some IRC servers do (dalnet I think) a settings was added for this one
      (nick-len).</FONT>

    <STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">PENALTY
    CALCULATION</FONT></STRONG> 

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Eggdrop calculates penalty
      points on IRCNET now, so it won&#39;t flood itself off anymore.</FONT>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">SHARE
    MODULE</FONT></STRONG> 

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Share module got a new setting
      now (override-bots) which allows hub bots to override the leafs bot
      setting (botadress, telnet port and password). Please note, that this
      won&#39;t work with a 1.4 or even 1.3 bot.</FONT>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">TCL
    COMMANDS</FONT></STRONG> 

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">* All three commands to add
      stuff to the queues (puthelp, putserv and putquick) support the
      &#39;-next&#39; parameter now which pushes data to the front of the

    <STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">TRAFFIC
    ACCOUNTING</FONT></STRONG> 

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Eggdrop counts the whole
      traffic which it generates and receives through IRC, botnet and dcc
      now. You can access these statistics via the dcc command
      &#39;.traffic&#39;. Please note, that the counter gets reset every time
      a restart is done.</FONT>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color="#FF0000">TRANSFER
    / FILESYS MODULE</FONT></STRONG> 

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">The filesys and transfer
      modules have changed completely. Both can handle now unlimited filename
      lengths and description sizes. Incomplete downloads from the bot can be
      resumed now.</FONT><BR>
       <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">The db format of the filesys
      module was also changed to remove the limits imposed by the old format.
      There&#39;s nothing special for you to do as the old db is
      automatically converted to the new format when you first access it. You
      won&#39;t be able to downgrade to older versions after this though, so
      maybe you&#39;ll want to make a backup first.</FONT>

    <H2><STRONG>Changes made to Eggdrop 1.4.xx from
    Eggdrop1.3.xx</STRONG></H2>
    <STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color=
    "#FF0000">SHARING</FONT></STRONG> 

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Sharing has changed a little.
      You will notice that a resync buffer is kept for share bots when they
      disconnect. This allows for them not to have to send the entire
      userfile again when they reconnect. This is a much more efficient
      approach to syncing the user files.</FONT>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color=
    "#FF0000">BOTFLAGS</FONT></STRONG> 

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Bot flags have changed. It is
      recommended that you read the BOTNET document to learn more about
      linking bots. Major changes in how you configure a passive and
      aggressive bot.</FONT>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color=
    "#FF0000">USERFLAGS</FONT></STRONG> 

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">User flags have changed. You
      still have the basic flags but others have been added. Some changes to
      this are that if someone has a global +n they will automatically be
      given all the global flags available. You will also notice there are no
      more capital letters; each flag has its own unique letter. An example
      is the B flag, in previous versions, it stood for a botnet master. The
      new flag is t. For more information on these changes, see the .help
      whois for a list of all flags. 1.3.24 introduces a new flag for
      +stopnethack procedure flexibility: +w.</FONT>

    <STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color=
    "#FF0000">LANGUAGES</FONT></STRONG> 

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1">Almost everything the bot says
      now is in language file. This should allow the bot to be more versatile
      for other people that do not speak English. As soon as we start getting
      the translations in there will be a directory on ftp.eggheads.org that
      will contain ready to use language files. Look for it real soon.</FONT>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <STRONG><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1" color=
    "#FF0000">COMMANDS</FONT></STRONG> 

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><EM>.voice</EM> and <EM>
      .devoice</EM> commands where added in dcc chat. This will voice a user
      on a channel if the bot is oped. Likewise for the .devoice
      command.</FONT><BR>
       <FONT face="Arial, Helvetica" size="-1"><EM>.email</EM> is now support
      in userinfo1.0.tcl so if you want emails to work, use this :)</FONT>
